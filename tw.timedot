; this is a timedot file. It must start with a simple date, like above.
; To log time intervals that can be parsed by hledger, lines follow;
; 
; <acct:subacct><2+ spaces><qtty>[<2+ spaces><; comment>]
; 
; where <acct> could be any text <2+ spaces><qtty> could be dots
; (representing quarter-hours) or numbers or ordinals.
; For better description of the hledger timedot format go to
; timedot link
; To run reports on time logged, use the excellent http://hleger.org.
; Once installed, to start out, run "hledger" without arguments,
; to see what reports are available. Then (in the case if a default
; task-timelog-hook install) run, for example;
; hledger -f ~/.task/hooks/task-timelog-hooks/tw.ledger bal
; see: https://github.com/linuxcaffe/task-timelog-hook/README.md
